# Healthcare_BI_ETL
An automated ETL pipeline for processing healthcare survey data, analyzing patient satisfaction and operational metrics, and visualizing insights through PostgreSQL and interactive dashboards

This independent project highlights my ability to design, implement, and deliver impactful data solutions that align with real-world healthcare challenges. The project emphasizes ETL pipeline development, statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and dashboardingâ€”all critical skills for a data analyst role in the healthcare industry.

## Dataset
Using the HCAHPS (Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems) dataset, the project showcases data engineering, advanced analytics, machine learning, and visualization skills to deliver insights that can drive measurable improvements in healthcare quality.
